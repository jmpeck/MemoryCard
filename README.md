# MemoryCard

I created MemoryCard, a flashcard maker, to help students study subjects that require rote memorization. Right now it is set up to create cards with a front side, back side and assigned subject. For test purposes the subjects are Spanish, Calculus, and Programming. The user can review, edit and delete cards as well as select them by subject to study on the "Practice" page. Right now the "Practice" page is simply a table with the back side of the card hidden until it is clicked. Eventually the "Practice" function will take in user input and track progress.

To use this web application, simply clone the solution and run the program in a browser.
